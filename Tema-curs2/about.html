   <p>Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
     It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. 
    Both components have a nearly identical API. Like Node.js, it is event-driven.</p>
